This repository contains the code base for our 2018-2019 robot for the VEX Robotics competition.

This robot had a flywheel - to shoot balls at targets - and a manipulator - to stack objects on poles - in addition to a drivetrain and ball indexing mechanism. 

This code was programmed in C++ using PROS (Purdue Robotics Operating System). 

The code contains the following
  1. General user control code and macros
  2. PID to control the flywheel velocity
  3. PID to control the drivetrain
  4. Autonomous routines
